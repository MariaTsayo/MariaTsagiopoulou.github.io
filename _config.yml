  Maria Tsagiopoulou, PhD, is a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB)/ Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH). 
  After her BSc in Molecular biology and genetics in 2014, she received the PhD degree from the Biology department of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens 
  in collaboration with the INAB/CERTH in 2019, working under the supervision of Dr. Kostas Stamatopoulos (Blood. 2007, Blood. 2012). 
  Her PhD thesis was entitled: «Epigenetic mechanisms in chronic lymphocytic leukemia» and was granted by the State Scholarships Foundation (IKY). 
  Her interests extend to the development of new bioinformatics tools using machine learning for the integration of 
  high-throughput data, particularly DNA methylation arrays, WES and RNA-seq data, and also link them with relevant publicly available data. 
  Moreover, her research interests also include the better use of publicly available NGS data, in support of open science and reproducibility of scientific results. 
  She was awarded with the Short-term collaboration award of the European Hematology Association in order to visit IDIBAPS, Barcelona and work with the group of Dr. Martín-Subero, 
  a leading expert in the field of cancer epigenomics (Nat Genet. 2012, Nat Genet. 2015, Cancer Cell. 2016, Nature Med. 2018). 
  Also, she participated on bioinformatic courses to assist in strengthening her bioinformatics expertise such as 
  The Volos Summer School in Human Genetics of Wellcome Sanger Institute, Bioinformatics and genome analyses, 
  EMBO Courses & workshops and Analysis of High-Throughput Sequencing Data of EMBL-EBI. More recently, she was awarded as an Early Career on Research Data Alliance (RDA) Europe. 
  She is involved in several data-related training activities, has been co-teaching at the CODATA-RDA Research Data Science Advanced Workshops on Advanced Bioinformatics workshop 
  and is an Instructor of the Carpentries.
