    InterTADs is an open-source tool written in R, for integrating multi-omics data (e.g. DNA methylation, expression, mutation) 
    from the same physical source (e.g. patient) taking into account the chromatin configuration of the genome, i.e. the topologically associating domains (TADs).

    In CLL, subsets of patients carrying stereotyped B cell receptors (BcR) share similar biological and clinical features independently of 
    IGHV gene somatic hypermutation status. Although the chromatin landscape of CLL as a whole has been recently characterized, it remains 
    largely unexplored in stereotyped cases. Here, we analyzed the active chromatin regulatory landscape of 3 major CLL stereotyped subsets associated with clinical aggressiveness.

    Altogether, this project confirms the significance of DNA methylation in CLL, 
    provides insight into the mechanism of the progression and relapse and further unravels 
    the DNA methylation landscape in cytogenetic subgroups and stereotyped subsets of CLL.
